# **Medical Dataset Cleaning and Preprocessing**

This Task demonstrates the **data cleaning and preprocessing** of a raw medical dataset to prepare it for analysis or machine learning tasks. The dataset often contains **missing values, duplicates, inconsistent formats, and unstandardized text**, which can affect data quality and insights.

## **Purpose**

The main goal of this Task is to:

* Handle **missing values** in numeric and text columns.
* Remove **duplicate rows** to ensure unique records.
* **Standardize text values** like gender, disease type, or city names for consistency.
* Convert **date columns** to a uniform format for accurate time-based analysis.
* Rename columns to a **clean, uniform naming convention**.
* Correct **data types** for numeric, text, and date fields.

## **Tools Used**

* **Python**
* **Pandas** library for data manipulation
* **Google Colab** (or Jupyter Notebook)

## **Features**

* Automatically detects numeric and text columns for missing value handling.
* Standardizes text entries like gender to ensure consistency.
* Converts date columns to `datetime` objects for easier analysis.
* Saves the cleaned dataset as a CSV ready for further analysis.
